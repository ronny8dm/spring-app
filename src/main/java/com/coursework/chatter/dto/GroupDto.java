DTOs are commonly used to transfer data between the API layer and the UI layer,
or between the API layer and the service layer. The primary purpose of a DTO is to transport data,
and it does not contain any business logic.

- DTOs he;p hide the internal structure of your domain model from the client.
- DTOs help decouple your service layer from your API layer.
- DTOs help limit over-fetching and under-fetching of data.
- DTOs help you avoid serialization problems.
